   a) Rename the jar file to - `spark-hive-example-3.1.2.jar`
   b) Place this jar file in - `opt/spark/examples/jars`
   c) Create the image from Dockerfile (spark-3.1.2) and place it in -
   `gcr.io/mapr-252711/spark-3.1.2-hive-example`

   
2. Create PVCs with the name - `spark-hive-claim`
   and place the file kv1.txt in
   `/opt/spark/work-dir/spark-warehouse/`
